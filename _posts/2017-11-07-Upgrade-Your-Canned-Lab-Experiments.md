### Upgrade Your Canned Lab Experiments

Ideally our students should design and conduct their own laboratory experiments in their science classes. This is a level of success which I have yet to have with my students in our 6th grade earth science class. I do believe that students should be involved as much as possible in the construction of their classroom lives; but due to time, safety and avialiablity materials, I haven't found feesable this instructional model. If you have, please hit the comments section with your suggestions and expertise.

What is second best if we aren't going to have our students designing their own experiments?
