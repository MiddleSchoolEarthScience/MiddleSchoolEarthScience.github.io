### Five Ways to Improve Lab Experiments

Ideally our students should design and conduct their own laboratory experiments in their science classes. This is a level of success which I have yet to have with my students in our 6th grade earth science class. I do believe that students should be involved as much as possible in the construction of their classroom lives; but due to time, safety and avialiablity materials, I haven't found this instructional model feesable. My students have had great success when I made these five easy modifications to canned lab experiments:

1. (Marking the text and procedures)[#mark_the_text]  
2. (Remove tables and charts)[#remove_tables]  
3. (Require students to graph their data)[#graph_data]   
4. (Edit the post-lab questions)[#edit_questions]   
5. (Require students to reflect on their learning)[#reflect]
