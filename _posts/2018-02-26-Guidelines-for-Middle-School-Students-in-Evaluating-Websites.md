Websites with many advertisements are trying to sell things to you; avoid these websites.

These are the guidelines I give my students to help them find high quality websites for in-class research. They are not perfect, but they save us a lot of time. What strategies have you found useful to improve your students ability to decern high quality online content? Please share your methods in the comment section bellow.
