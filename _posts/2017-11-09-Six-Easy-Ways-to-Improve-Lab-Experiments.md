title: Six Easy Ways to Improve Lab Experiments
published: false
---

Ideally our students should design and conduct their own laboratory experiments in their science classes. This is a level of success which I have yet to have with my students in our 6th grade earth science class. I do believe that students should be involved as much as possible in the construction of their classroom lives; but due to time, safety and avialiablity materials, I haven't found this instructional model feesable. My students have had great success when I made these six easy modifications to canned lab experiments:

1. [Marking the text](#mark_the_text)
2. [Identify variables in the procedures](#procedures)
3. [Remove tables and charts](#remove_tables)  
4. [Require students to graph their data](#graph_data)   
5. [Edit the post-lab questions](#edit_questions)   
6. [Require students to reflect on their learning](#reflect)

Most of the lab experiments my students do are heavily modified versions of experiments I inherited from my predicessor. All of them start with a block of text explaining basic information about the topic we are studying. Reading this block of text is a perfect opportunity for students to practice marking the text. Marking text is a series of strategies which help students to identify new vocabulary, identify unknown words and to generally make meaning from a text. Here is an example protocal your students could follow:

1. Read the text in its entirety to the class. This serves as an opportunity for struggling readers to hear fluent reading and to have access to a text they otherwise wouldn't. Alternatively, you can ask for a volunteer to read the text; be sure to pick a student who is a strong reader.
2. Read or ask for a volunteer to read any post-lab questions to the class.
3. Ask students to read the text to themselves and:
   * Put a box around new vocabulary
   * Underline phrases they think will be helpful when answering post-lab questions.
   * Place a question mark in the margins for passages they found difficult to understand.
4. Ask students to share which words the put a box around and answer questions about vocabulary.

Proceed with the lab activity as you normally would. While you are circulating around the room check in with students about the sections they noted with question marks. This simple text marking activity will help your students to make more meaning of the text and hopefull increase their understanding of the tasks they are performing in the experiment.
