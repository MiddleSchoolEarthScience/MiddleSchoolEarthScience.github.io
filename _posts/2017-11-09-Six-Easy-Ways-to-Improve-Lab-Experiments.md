title: Six Easy Ways to Improve Lab Experiments
published: true
---

Ideally our students should design and conduct their own laboratory experiments in their science classes. I have yet to realize this ideal with my students in our 6th grade earth science class. I do believe that students should be involved as much as possible in the construction of their classroom lives; but due to time, safety and avialiablity materials, I haven't found this instructional model feesable. My students have had great success when I made these six easy modifications to our lab experiments:

1. [Marking the text](#mark_the_text)
2. [Identifying variables in the procedures and removing premade data tables](#procedures)  
3. [Require students to graph their data](#graph_data)   
4. [Edit the post-lab questions](#edit_questions)   
5. [Require students to reflect on their learning](#reflect)   

### <a id="mark_the_text"></a>Marking the text
Most of the lab experiments my students do are heavily modified versions of experiments I inherited from my predicessor. All of the lab experiments start with a block of text explaining basic information about the topic we are studying. Reading this block of text is a perfect opportunity for students to practice marking the text. Marking text is a series of strategies which help students to identify new vocabulary, identify unknown words and to generally make meaning from a text. Here is a simple protocal to use with your students:

#### Simple Text Marking Protocal for Lab Experiments
> 1. Read the text in its entirety to the class. This serves as an opportunity for struggling readers to hear fluent reading and to have access to a text they otherwise wouldn't. Alternatively, you can ask for a volunteer to read the text; be sure to pick a student who is a strong reader.
> 2. Read or ask for a volunteer to read any post-lab questions to the class.
> 3. Ask students to read the text to themselves and:
>    * Put a box around new vocabulary
>    * Underline phrases they think will be helpful when answering post-lab questions.
>    * Place a question mark in the margins for passages they found difficult to understand.
> 4. Ask students to share which words they put a box around and answer questions about vocabulary.
> 5. Proceed with the lab activity as you normally would.
> 6. While you are circulating around the room check in with students about the sections they noted with question marks.

This simple text marking activity will help your students to make more meaning of the text and increase their understanding of the tasks they are performing.

### <a id="procedures"></a>Identifying variables in the procedures and removing premade data tables
Similarly to marking the text, students benefit from a close reading of the lab procedures. Beyond understanding what to do, students need to learn to identify the idenpendent, dependent and constant variables in an experiment. To help them with this I first remove all premade data tables students would otherwise use to collect information--this needs to be done before making copies. Then during class while reading the procedures I ask students to underline any variables being measure or refered to as needing to be recorded in a data table. After students have underline what THEY think is important, I ask them to make a rough draft of a data table on a seperate sheet of paper. Give them a defined and short amount of time for this, no more than 5 minutes. I have them share their rough draft data tables with their desk partners and ask for volunteers to share their work with the class using a document camera. Through discussion I guide students into understanding which variables actually need to be measured and which are the constant, dependent and independent variables. Usually a student will have shared a workable data table, and I will request to keep it under the document camera and ask the class to copy it into their lab report as a final draft.

#### If the wall of text above was too much to read, here is the short version:
> 1. Remove premade data tables before copying the lab experiment.
> 2. Have students identify variables in the procedures by underlining them.
> 3. Ask students to make a rough draft of a data table to collect the variables they identified.
> 4. Have students share their data tables with the class.
> 5. Select a usable data table and have students copy it as a final draft into their lab paper.

In my graduate work I found that asking student to create a data table to collect their results significantly increased their understanding of which factors in an experiment were the independent, dependent and constant variables. Creating a data table might not seem significant, but it requires students to think deeply about what is, and is not, imporant in a well designed experiment.
